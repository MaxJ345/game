==INTRODUCTION==
README for 'game'.
This project is an extension on the C++ text-based game that my group (Colin Ryan, Andrew Eatman, Thatcher Buckley, Graham Entwistle) and I (Maxwell Jacob) created for a school project. With this, I hope to improve upon and update the original game.


==FILES==
Currently the directory contains the following files and folders:

	--DIRECTORIES--
	test - this directory contains test files for algorithms, etc.
	original - this directory contains the files for the original game
    project - contains the actual [CodeBlocks] project. This includes all source files and some files that are produced by [CodeBlocks].


==STATUS==

06 Jun. 2016 - There's been plenty of progress over the past months. For a while I wasn't working on it, but I've picked it back up. Many of the current main systems/classes include: rooms (and room gen./del.; also includes a grid/map system), characters, prompt, items, stashes (collection/array of items).

03 Feb. 2016 - A test of the system (as of now) has been created. It contains roomGen, roomDelete, golbally-declared variables, coordinates list, and the logic to prevent "overlapping" (take up the same coordinate position) rooms.

The roomGen and roomDelete functions are currently working! They need to be updated (cleaned up, broken up into more functions, add grid-system for roomGen, etc.), but the basic logic of each algorithm is working.


==FUTURE==
Now I will focus on revamping, and redesigning old code (from original game) and high-level design of the game.
Make pointer variable to keep global access to probability function (as opposed to passing it a seed all the time).
All of the game's code should take advantage of object-oriented design (classes, etc.).
Revamp current code to make sure it has validation/error-checking wherever applicable.
