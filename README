==INTRODUCTION==
README for 'game'.
This project is an extension on the C++ text-based game that my group (Colin Ryan, Andrew Eatman, Thatcher Buckley, Graham Entwistle) and I (Maxwell Jacob) created for a school project. With this, I hope to improve upon and update the original game.


==FILES==
Currently the directory contains the following files and folders:

	--FILES--
	roomGen.cpp - this file contains the function that procedurally/recursively generates a complex of interlinked rooms
	roomDelete.cpp - this file recursively deletes a complex of interlinked rooms

	--DIRECTORIES--
	test - this directory contains test files for algorithms, etc.
	original - this directory contains the files for the original game


==STATUS==

The roomGen and roomDelete functions are currently working! They need to be updated (cleaned up, broken up into more functions, add grid-system for roomGen, etc.), but the basic logic of each algorithm is working.


==FUTURE==
Now I will focus on revamping, and redesigning old code (from original game) and high-level design of the game.
I hope to add a grid system and map system to complement roomGen.
Make pointer variable to keep global access to probability function (as opposed to passing it a seed all the time).
All of the game's code should take advantage of object-oriented design (classes, etc.).
Revamp current code to make sure it has validation/error-checking wherever applicable.
