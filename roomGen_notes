recursively generating rooms

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

srand(time(NULL));

roomGen(branchRoomPtr, randomNum)
{
	if (only first room exists)	// base case; make sure to use randomness/percentage here
		roomGen(northRoomPtr);
		roomGen(southRoomPtr);
		roomGen(eastRoomPtr);
		roomGen(westRoomPtr);
	else						// this will lead to infinite recursion, so we should use a percentage/random-number that gets smaller as it goes through multiple levels of recursion
		// create and allocate memory for rooms that need to be created
		// check the direction the branch is from...
		// make sure not to generate in that direction
		
		// with random chance:
		roomGen all except the one in direction of the branch
}


as we get deeper in the recursion --> randomSeed++
initial randomSeed = 1

loop(all roomPtr's)
	if(rand() % randomSeed == 0)
		roomGen(...);


// room layout:
roomContents
pointers to other rooms; one pair of pointers (coming in / going out) for each direction (north, south, east, west)




// check for collisions/overlapping rooms
